Stand-Alone & Series Audiobooks

I have been collecting Audiobooks for over a year and wanted to share, what I have collected.   Please do not connect directly to the shared google drive account but download it to your own cloud storage.   If you have any questions please contact me.

This is just an embedded iframe of the airtable database, if I get more time I will pull this in for a more eloquent solution.

Audiobook instructions: copy The Audiobook to your Google Drive/Dropbox or any other Cloud Storage application.

If the audiobook is in a Series or Stand-Alone Book, please navigate to the applicable section 
Book Series
Stand-Alone Books
